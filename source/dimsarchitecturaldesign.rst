DIMS architectural design
=========================

.. note:: TBD

   This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   describe the DIMS architectural design. If part or all of the design
   depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall be
   indicated. If design information falls into more than one paragraph,
   it may be presented once and referenced from the other
   paragraphs. Design conventions needed to understand the design shall
   be presented or referenced.

   PRISEM Hardware Layout Diagram.



Figure :ref:`PRISEMHardwareLayoutDiagram` shows the physical hardware
configuration for PRISEM system components in the server rack located
in the UW Tower IT data center. Green boxes are those used for PRISEM
(and now for some DIMS) related systems, while white and gray boxes
are either unused or occupied by other resources. Some of the physical
hardware (e.g., the systems labeled "IBM" and "Eclipse") are obsolete
and are being replaced by virtual machines to be housed in newly added
hardware located in slots 7+8. (The VLAN switch labeled "CoS" will
also be replaced in the near future with the D-Link VLAN switch below
it.) Hardware supporting the DIMS project has not yet been purchased,
though space has been reserved for it in the same rack to facilitate
high-speed network access behind the PRISEM firewall and OpenVPN
servers. (See other Figures for PRISEM + DIMS Architecture
descriptions).

The principal PRISEM hardware consists of Dell PowerEdge servers. Two
PowerEdge 1950 (pink.seattle.gov and floyd.prisem.washington.edu) are
used for log collection, NetFlow processing, and the CIF database. Two
Dell R720 (zion.prisem.washington.edu and money.prisem.washington.edu)
servers are used for the Log Matrix Threat Center and Log Center
servers. Both zion and money are replacements for the original Dell
R710 servers purchased at the start of the project in 2008. Virtual
machines are run on a Dell PowerEdge R715 server, with 128GB RAM,
2x12-Core 1.8GHz AMD Opteron processors, and 12 â€“ 1TB drives in a RAID
5 array.

Physical networking is provided by 1 GigE switches, some configured to
support virtual LAN (VLAN) isolation. (One is a D-Link xStack Managed
24-Port Gigabit L2+ 1/10-GigE switch, another a D-Link DXS-3227 1-GigE
managed switch). One VLAN provides an isolated network for
inter-system communication behind a vendor-supported stateful firewall
and OpenVPN server for remote access. Another VLAN provides
internet-routable connections in front of the firewall. At present,
only IPv4 is supported for network connectivity


The DIMS system will conform with the hardware/software separation
used by the Ops-Trust and PRISEM systems, which pre-date the DIMS
project. In both of these projects, some separation of services across
physical and/or virtual machines is done for various reasons of
performance, scalability, speed, ease of administration, conformance
with operating system version dependencies, etc. DIMS components will
be separate (where appropriate) for similar reasons, and integrated as
much as possible by combining similar services in order to minimize
the total number of physical and/or virtual machines in use. For
example, if there are three domain name servers, they can be combined
into one server that handles multiple domains.

DIMS components
---------------

SIEM event correlation server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PRISEM system uses a Log Matrix "Threat Center" system, hosted on
a high-end Dell server with multiple cores, large RAM capacity, an SSD
drive to accelerate database activities, and 2TB RAID 1 array for disk
fault tolerance. This system runs CentOS 6.4.


SIEM log archive server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PRISEM system uses a Log Matrix "Log Center" system, hosted on a
high-end Dell server with multiple cores, and 9TB RAID 5 array disk
fault tolerance. This system runs CentOS 5.10 (due to compatibility
issues with the Vertica database).

Virtual machine management server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PRISEM system uses a Dell PowerEdge R715 for virtual machine hosting.


AMQP broker
^^^^^^^^^^^

The PRISEM system uses a virtual machine running RabbitMQ for AMQP
broker services.


Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF) server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PRISEM system is using a CIF v0.1 database on physical hardware
(Dell PowerEdge 1950). This system will be replaced with a virtual
machine running CIF v1.0 (or newer).

ID management and authentication server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ops-Trust and DIMS projects are using OpenID and LemonLDAP (though
in slightly different ways). The intention is to combine these into a
single pair of OpenID/LDAP servers.

Domain name server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ops-Trust system runs its own DNS server for all system components
in a single-purpose VM. The PRISEM project is currently using static
host tables and DNSMasq in slightly different ways (depending on
whether access is from the open internet, or through the OpenVPN
tunnel). It is anticipated that a split-DNS configuration, using the
same server as the Ops-Trust infrastructure, will be used in the long
run to get consistent DNS response regardless of access method used.

Virtual private network tunnel server(s)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PRISEM project has an OpenVPN server for remote access to the
backdoor VLAN. This allows access to the AMQP broker, and direct
access to the MySQL databases used by Log Matrix. (The vendor
maintains their own Cisco managed VPN/firewall for access from their
internal network).

Internal Communications Architecture 
------------------------------------

In this section, describe the overall communications within the
system; for example, LANs, buses, etc. Include the communications
architecture(s) being implemented, such as X.25, Token Ring,
etc. Provide a diagram depicting the communications path(s) between
the system and subsystem modules. If appropriate, use subsections to
address each architecture being employed.

The DIMS system will be built on top of the legacy PRISEM
system. PRISEM has interfaces to some of its services that integrate
an instance of the Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF) database
for IP-based reputation watchlists and historic attacker context, an
archive of historic event logs, and remotely stored network flow data
in SiLK format. The logical architecture that integrates these systems
is a combination of message bus (using AMQP), SSH tunneled file and/or
command line access, or HTTPS web interfaces and RESTful API.


This paragraph shall:

    * Identify the software units that make up the DIMS. Each software unit
      shall be assigned a project-unique identifier.

.. note::

    A software unit is an element in the design of a DIMS; for example, a
    major subdivision of a DIMS, a component of that subdivision, a class,
    object, module, function, routine, or database. Software units may occur
    at different levels of a hierarchy and may consist of other software
    units. Software units in the design may or may not have a one-to-one
    relationship with the code and data entities (routines, procedures,
    databases, data files, etc.) that implement them or with the computer
    files containing those entities. A database may be treated as a DIMS or
    as a software unit. The SDD may refer to software units by any name(s)
    consistent with the design methodology being used. 

..

    * Show the static (such as "consists of") relationship(s) of the software
      units. Multiple relationships may be presented, depending on the
      selected software design methodology (for example, in an
      object-oriented design, this paragraph may present the class and object
      structures as well as the module and process architectures of the
      DIMS).

    * State the purpose of each software unit and identify the DIMS
      requirements and DIMS-wide design decisions allocated to it.
      (Alternatively, the allocation of requirements may be provided in 6.a.)

    * Identify each software unit's development status/type (such as new
      development, existing design or software to be reused as is, existing
      design or software to be reengineered, software to be developed for
      reuse, software planned for Build N, etc.) For existing design or
      software, the description shall provide identifying information, such
      as name, version, documentation references, library, etc.

    * Describe the DIMS's (and as applicable, each software unit's) planned
      utilization of computer hardware resources (such as processor capacity,
      memory capacity, input/output device capacity, auxiliary storage
      capacity, and communications/network equipment capacity). The
      description shall cover all computer hardware resources included in
      resource utilization requirements for the DIMS, in system-level
      resource allocations affecting the DIMS, and in resource utilization
      measurement planning in the Software Development Plan. If all
      utilization data for a given computer hardware resource are presented
      in a single location, such as in one SDD, this paragraph may reference
      that source. Included for each computer hardware resource shall be:

        * The DIMS requirements or system-level resource allocations being
          satisfied

        * The assumptions and conditions on which the utilization data are
          based (for example, typical usage, worst-case usage, assumption of
          certain events)

        * Any special considerations affecting the utilization (such as use
          of virtual memory, overlays, or multiprocessors or the impacts of
          operating system overhead, library software, or other
          implementation overhead)

        * The units of measure used (such as percentage of processor
          capacity, cycles per second, bytes of memory, kilobytes per second)

        * The level(s) at which the estimates or measures will be made (such
          as software unit, DIMS, or executable program)

    * Identify the program library in which the software that implements each
      software unit is to be placed


.. conceptofexecution:

Concept of execution
--------------------

.. note:: TBD

   This paragraph shall describe the concept of execution among the software
   units. It shall include diagrams and descriptions showing the dynamic
   relationship of the software units, that is, how they will interact during
   DIMS operation, including, as applicable, flow of execution control, data
   flow, dynamically controlled sequencing, state transition diagrams, timing
   diagrams, priorities among units, handling of interrupts, timing/sequencing
   relationships, exception handling, concurrent execution, dynamic
   allocation/deallocation, dynamic creation/deletion of objects, processes,
   tasks, and other aspects of dynamic behavior.

.. interfacedesign:

Interface design
----------------

.. note:: TBD

   This paragraph shall be divided into the following subparagraphs to describe
   the interface characteristics of the software units. It shall include both
   interfaces among the software units and their interfaces with external
   entities such as systems, configuration items, and users. If part or all of
   this information is contained in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), in
   section 5 of the SDD, or elsewhere, these sources may be referenced.

.. interfaceiddiagrams:

Interface identification and diagrams
-------------------------------------

.. note:: TBD

   This paragraph shall state the project-unique identifier assigned to each
   interface and shall identify the interfacing entities (software units,
   systems, configuration items, users, etc.) by name, number, version, and
   documentation references, as applicable. The identification shall state which
   entities have fixed interface characteristics (and therefore impose interface
   requirements on interfacing entities) and which are being developed or
   modified (thus having interface requirements imposed on them). One or more
   interface diagrams shall be provided, as appropriate, to depict the
   interfaces.

.. projectid_A:

(Project unique identifier of interface)
----------------------------------------

This paragraph (beginning with 4.3.2) shall identify an interface by project
unique identifier, shall briefly identify the interfacing entities, and shall
be divided into subparagraphs as needed to describe the interface
characteristics of one or both of the interfacing entities. If a given
interfacing entity is not covered by this SDD (for example, an external
system) but its interface characteristics need to be mentioned to describe
interfacing entities that are, these characteristics shall be stated as
assumptions or as "When [the entity not covered] does this, [the entity that
is covered] will . . . ." This paragraph may reference other documents (such
as data dictionaries, standards for protocols, and standards for user
interfaces) in place of stating the information here. The design description
shall include the following, as applicable, presented in any order suited to
the information to be provided, and shall note any differences in these
characteristics from the point of view of the interfacing entities (such as
different expectations about the size, frequency, or other characteristics of
data elements):

    * Priority assigned to the interface by the interfacing entity(ies)

    * Type of interface (such as real-time data transfer, storage-and-retrieval of data, etc.) to be implemented

        * Accuracy (how correct) and precision (number of significant digits)

        * Priority, timing, frequency, volume, sequencing, and other constraints, such as whether the data element may be updated and whether business rules apply

        * Security and privacy constraints

        * Sources (setting/sending entities) and recipients (using/receiving entities)

    * Characteristics of data element assemblies (records, messages, files, arrays, displays, reports, etc.) that the interfacing entity(ies) will provide, store, send, access, receive, etc., such as:

 	* Names/identifiers

            * Project-unique identifier

            * Non-technical (natural language) name
