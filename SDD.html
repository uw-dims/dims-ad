<h1>2. Referenced documents.</h1>
<p>This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of all documents referenced in this document. This section shall also identify the source for all documents not available through normal Government stocking activities.</p>

<h1>3.	CSCI-wide design decisions. </h1>
<p>This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to present CSCI-wide design decisions, that is, decisions about the CSCI's behavioral design (how it will behave, from a user's point of view, in meeting its requirements, ignoring internal implementation) and other decisions affecting the selection and design of the software units that make up the CSCI. If all such decisions are explicit in the CSCI requirements or are deferred to the design of the CSCI's software units, this section shall so state. Design decisions that respond to requirements designated critical, such as those for safety, security, or privacy, shall be placed in separate subparagraphs. If a design decision depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall be indicated. Design conventions needed to understand the design shall be presented or referenced. Examples of CSCI-wide design decisions are the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>Design decisions regarding inputs the CSCI will accept and outputs it will produce, including interfaces with other systems, HWCIs, CSCIs, and users (4.3.x of this DID identifies topics to be considered in this description). If part or all of this information is given in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), they may be referenced. </li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on CSCI behavior in response to each input or condition, including actions the CSCI will perform, response times and other performance characteristics, description of physical systems modeled, selected equations/algorithms/rules, and handling of unallowed inputs or conditions.</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on how databases/data files will appear to the user (4.3.x of this DID identifies topics to be considered in this description). If part or all of this information is given in Database Design Descriptions (DBDDs), they may be referenced. </li><br/>
 <li>Selected approach to meeting safety, security, and privacy requirements.</li><br/>
 <li>Other CSCI-wide design decisions made in response to requirements, such as selected approach to providing required flexibility, availability, and maintainability.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>4.	CSCI architectural design. </h1>
<p>This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to describe the CSCI architectural design. If part or all of the design depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall be indicated. If design information falls into more than one paragraph, it may be presented once and referenced from the other paragraphs. Design conventions needed to understand the design shall be presented or referenced. </p>

<h2>4.1		CSCI components.</h2>
<p>This paragraph shall:
<ol type="a">
	<li>Identify the software units that make up the CSCI. Each software unit shall be assigned a project-unique identifier.
 <br/><br/>
 Note: A software unit is an element in the design of a CSCI; for example, a major subdivision of a CSCI, a component of that subdivision, a class, object, module, function, routine, or database. Software units may occur at different levels of a hierarchy and may consist of other software units. Software units in the design may or may not have a one-to-one relationship with the code and data entities (routines, procedures, databases, data files, etc.) that implement them or with the computer files containing those entities. A database may be treated as a CSCI or as a software unit. The SDD may refer to software units by any name(s) consistent with the design methodology being used. 
 </li><br/>
 <li>Show the static (such as "consists of") relationship(s) of the software units. Multiple relationships may be presented, depending on the selected software design methodology (for example, in an object-oriented design, this paragraph may present the class and object structures as well as the module and process architectures of the CSCI).</li><br/>
 <li>State the purpose of each software unit and identify the CSCI requirements and CSCI-wide design decisions allocated to it. (Alternatively, the allocation of requirements may be provided in 6.a.)</li><br/>
 <li>Identify each software unit's development status/type (such as new development, existing design or software to be reused as is, existing design or software to be reengineered, software to be developed for reuse, software planned for Build N, etc.) For existing design or software, the description shall provide identifying information, such as name, version, documentation references, library, etc.</li><br/>
 <li>Describe the CSCI's (and as applicable, each software unit's) planned utilization of computer hardware resources (such as processor capacity, memory capacity, input/output device capacity, auxiliary storage capacity, and communications/network equipment capacity). The description shall cover all computer hardware resources included in resource utilization requirements for the CSCI, in system-level resource allocations affecting the CSCI, and in resource utilization measurement planning in the Software Development Plan. If all utilization data for a given computer hardware resource are presented in a single location, such as in one SDD, this paragraph may reference that source. Included for each computer hardware resource shall be:
 	<ol>
 	<li>The CSCI requirements or system-level resource allocations being satisfied</li>
 <li>The assumptions and conditions on which the utilization data are based (for example, typical usage, worst-case usage, assumption of certain events)</li>
 <li>Any special considerations affecting the utilization (such as use of virtual memory, overlays, or multiprocessors or the impacts of operating system overhead, library software, or other implementation overhead)</li>
 <li>The units of measure used (such as percentage of processor capacity, cycles per second, bytes of memory, kilobytes per second)</li>
 <li>The level(s) at which the estimates or measures will be made (such as software unit, CSCI, or executable program)</li>
 </ol>
 </li><br/>
 <li>Identify the program library in which the software that implements each software unit is to be placed</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>4.2		Concept of execution. </h2>
<p>This paragraph shall describe the concept of execution among the software units. It shall include diagrams and descriptions showing the dynamic relationship of the software units, that is, how they will interact during CSCI operation, including, as applicable, flow of execution control, data flow, dynamically controlled sequencing, state transition diagrams, timing diagrams, priorities among units, handling of interrupts, timing/sequencing relationships, exception handling, concurrent execution, dynamic allocation/deallocation, dynamic creation/deletion of objects, processes, tasks, and other aspects of dynamic behavior.</p>

<h2>4.3		Interface design.</h2>
<p>This paragraph shall be divided into the following subparagraphs to describe the interface characteristics of the software units. It shall include both interfaces among the software units and their interfaces with external entities such as systems, configuration items, and users. If part or all of this information is contained in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), in section 5 of the SDD, or elsewhere, these sources may be referenced. </p>

<h3>4.3.1		Interface identification and diagrams.</h3>
<p>This paragraph shall state the project-unique identifier assigned to each interface and shall identify the interfacing entities (software units, systems, configuration items, users, etc.) by name, number, version, and documentation references, as applicable. The identification shall state which entities have fixed interface characteristics (and therefore impose interface requirements on interfacing entities) and which are being developed or modified (thus having interface requirements imposed on them). One or more interface diagrams shall be provided, as appropriate, to depict the interfaces. </p>

<h3>4.3.x		(Project unique identifier of interface). </h3>
<p>This paragraph (beginning with 4.3.2) shall identify an interface by project unique identifier, shall briefly identify the interfacing entities, and shall be divided into subparagraphs as needed to describe the interface characteristics of one or both of the interfacing entities. If a given interfacing entity is not covered by this SDD (for example, an external system) but its interface characteristics need to be mentioned to describe interfacing entities that are, these characteristics shall be stated as assumptions or as "When [the entity not covered] does this, [the entity that is covered] will . . . ." This paragraph may reference other documents (such as data dictionaries, standards for protocols, and standards for user interfaces) in place of stating the information here. The design description shall include the following, as applicable, presented in any order suited to the information to be provided, and shall note any differences in these characteristics from the point of view of the interfacing entities (such as different expectations about the size, frequency, or other characteristics of data elements):
